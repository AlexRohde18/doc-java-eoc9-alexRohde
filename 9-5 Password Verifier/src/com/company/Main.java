	    PROGRAM 9-5 PASSWORD VERIFIER
    ====================================================================================================================
    Imagine you are developing a software package for Amazon.com that requires users to
    enter their own passwords. Your software requires that users' passwords meet the
    following criteria:
        - The password should be at least six characters long.
        - The password should contain at least one uppercase and at least one lowercase letter.
        - The password should have at least one digit.
    Write a class that verifies that a password meets the stated criteria. Demonstrate the class in
    a program that allows the user to enter a password and then displays a message indicating
    whether it is valid or not.
